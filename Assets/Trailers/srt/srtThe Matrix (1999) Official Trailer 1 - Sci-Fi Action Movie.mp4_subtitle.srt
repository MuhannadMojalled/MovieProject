1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,790
Whoa. Have you ever had a dream,

2
00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:16,874
Neo, that you were so sure was real?

3
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:22,990
What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the

4
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,554
difference between the dream world and the real world?

5
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:32,734
What is happening to me? The answer is out there,

6
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:35,634
Neo. It's the question that drives us.

7
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:37,994
What is the Matrix?

8
00:00:39,654 --> 00:00:43,374
The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind

9
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:44,514
you from the truth.

10
00:00:46,694 --> 00:00:49,554
What truth? They're watching you, Neo.

11
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:57,254
Human beings are a disease. You are a cancer

12
00:00:57,294 --> 00:01:01,590
of this planet. And we are

13
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:05,022
the cure. Get me the

14
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:06,034
hell out of here.

15
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:12,074
Welcome to the real world.

16
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:20,880
So you're here to save the world. So, what do you need?

17
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:23,284
Guns. Lots of guns.

18
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:27,216
No one has ever done anything like this. That's why it's going to work.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,944
Buckle your seatbelt, Dorothy. Cause Kansas is going

20
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:31,884
bye bye.

21
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:11,678
Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix

22
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:14,614
is. You have to see it for yourself.
