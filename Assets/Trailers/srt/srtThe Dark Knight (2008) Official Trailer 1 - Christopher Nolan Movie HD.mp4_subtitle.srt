1
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,974
Where do we begin? A year ago

2
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:25,430
these cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross

3
00:00:25,502 --> 00:00:27,634
any of you. I mean, what happened?

4
00:00:29,974 --> 00:00:33,356
So, what are you proposing? Simple. Kill the

5
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,144
Batman.

6
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:42,184
Here's my card.

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,836
Bruce, this is Harvey Dent. Rachel's told me everything about you.

8
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,264
I certainly hope not.

9
00:00:51,764 --> 00:00:54,972
You once told me that we'd be together. Did you mean it?

10
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:58,344
Bruce? Don't make me your only hope for a normal life.

11
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:03,252
You're Alfred, right? That's right, sir. Any psychotic ex boyfriends

12
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:06,024
I should be aware? Oh, you have no idea.

13
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:11,304
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

14
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:16,996
We're tonight's entertainment. Well,

15
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,664
hello, beautiful.

16
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:24,084
You look nervous. I've seen

17
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:27,024
now what have to become to stop men like him.

18
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:32,160
The night is darkest just before the dawn. I promise

19
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,044
you the dawn is coming.

20
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:39,604
And here we go.

21
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:45,044
Come on.

22
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:50,764
This city deserves a better class of criminal.

23
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:55,004
I'm gonna give it to him. No.

24
00:01:56,904 --> 00:01:59,084
You'll see. I'll show you.

25
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:06,040
You either die a hero or you live long

26
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:07,764
enough to see yourself become the villain.

27
00:02:18,544 --> 00:02:21,904
Will you be wanting the bat pod, sir? Middle of the day, Alfred. Not very

28
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:23,844
subtle. The Lamborghini, then.

29
00:02:25,784 --> 00:02:26,624
Much more subtle.
