00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,470
Stephen Spielberg presents back to the future of Robert Zemeckis

2
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:23,054
film Marty leads an ordinary life. No McFly ever

3
00:00:23,094 --> 00:00:26,686
amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. History is

4
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,886
going to change. And 1985 is not his

5
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,038
year. But Doctor Brown is about to change all that.

6
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,994
Are you telling me you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?

7
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:43,198
He's sending Marty 30 years back

8
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:47,214
in time. It works. It's a slurry

9
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:51,094
saucer from outer space. Now he's

10
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,790
trapped in the past. It's gotta be a dream. About to meet

11
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:58,766
chocolate, his future father. He's a beeping Tom.

12
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,150
Wow. And he's making an impression on

13
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:06,102
his mother. And he can sleep in my

14
00:01:06,158 --> 00:01:09,646
room. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on

15
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,574
future events. Now he's got to make his mother and father

16
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:16,830
fall in love. For crying out loud. I haven't even been born yet.

17
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:20,166
And only Doctor Brown can help him

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,062
get back to the future.

19
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:25,670
Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?

20
00:01:25,782 --> 00:01:29,046
Precisely. Michael J. Fox. Whoa, Sammy.

21
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,374
Christopher Lloyd. There's that word again. Heavy. Why are things

22
00:01:32,414 --> 00:01:36,406
so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the earth's gravitational pull to

23
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:36,694
the future?
