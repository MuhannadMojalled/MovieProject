1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,194
Fairy tales can come true?

2
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:09,406
It can happen to you if you're

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,158
young at heart. Mirror, mirror on the wall is this not

4
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:17,030
the most perfect kingdom of them all? Well, technically,

5
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:20,126
it's not perfect. Uh,

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,074
Thelonious,

7
00:00:23,694 --> 00:00:28,030
you were saying? Twas long ago and far away?

8
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:31,114
In a land as different as night from day?

9
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:35,494
Fairy tale creatures are a magical sort? I'm not a puppet.

10
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:37,154
I'm a real boy.

11
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:43,158
This one's full. Take it away. We're banished by a prince

12
00:00:43,286 --> 00:00:47,274
who was really short? He hoofed and he puffed and he

13
00:00:47,654 --> 00:00:52,234
signed an eviction notice? You're a monster now,

14
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:56,438
the one to save their neck. Oh, you're expecting Prince

15
00:00:56,486 --> 00:00:59,496
Charming? Hey. Oh, no, no,

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,064
no. Gent girl, off the table. Where are we supposed to put her?

17
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,696
The bed's taken. What is a

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,576
hero named Shrek? Shrek. Shrek.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,324
Shrek.

20
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:17,016
That was really scary. And if you don't mind me saying, you definitely need

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,928
some tic tacs or something. Cause your breath stinks. But a tail like this will

22
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:23,044
also need a princess.

23
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:27,526
What? And a noble steed. All right,

24
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,862
I hope you heard that. You called me a noble steed? You think I'm a

25
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:34,398
steed? Mike Myers? Eddie Murphy? Cameron Diaz.

26
00:01:34,486 --> 00:01:38,310
John Lithgow? This is gonna be fun. We can stay up late swapping manly

27
00:01:38,342 --> 00:01:41,774
stories in the morning. I'm making waffles. Then I saw

28
00:01:41,814 --> 00:01:45,394
her face. Don't look down.

29
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:52,724
You think that Shrek. If you do, love. Well, yes,

30
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,776
Shrek. I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,664
serious therapy. Look at my eye twitching.
