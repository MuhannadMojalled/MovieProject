1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,822
It's breathtaking. When you

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:08,566
see sand here, imagine water. If you dive in, you can't

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,134
reach the bottom. You dive in? Yes. It's cold swimming.

4
00:00:12,294 --> 00:00:14,034
I don't. I don't believe you.

5
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:21,074
In the shadows of Arrakis lie many secrets.

6
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:28,790
But the darkest of them all may remain the

7
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:32,394
end of House Atreides. Your father didn't believe in revenge.

8
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:39,034
What if Paul Atreides were still alive?

9
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:57,994
Have you ever had a dream about your first ride?

10
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:05,904
Don't try to impress anyone.

11
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:10,864
You're brave, we all know that.

12
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:15,984
Be simple, be direct.

13
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:33,064
Nothing fancy. I understand.

14
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:41,384
Nothing fancy.

15
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:56,704
You will never lose me, Paul Andreides.

16
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:07,944
We gave them something to hope for. That's not hope.

17
00:02:09,924 --> 00:02:12,244
May thy knife chip and shatter.
